# Windows-Terminal-Preview
I created my own style of Windows Terminal Preview App

If you want to know more about the documentation of this application I leave you the following link, official documentation. Also I attach the image that I use in my case. To use the same JSON path you must create a folder called "Wallpaper_Terminal" in the Pictures library, in addition to changing the name of the path as specified in the file. If you want to leave another location then:
* Move the background to the desired location
* Properties
* Copy the path of "Location"
* You paste the path in the JSON and add the name of the image
    Example: "backgroundImage": "C: /PATH/wallpaper.jpg"
